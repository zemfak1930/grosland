# Grosland

**CAUSE**:  
In connection with the beginning of a full-scale invasion of the Russian federation into the territory of the independent 
republic of Ukraine, the state body in the field of geodesy, cartography and land management had to close access to the 
public cadastral map.

**CONSEQUENCES**:  
Although this decision is critically necessary, this action may entail the following consequences:

- Irrational use of land bank;
- Increased corruption in local governments;
- Complicating the development of technical documentation by certified land surveying engineers;
- Insufficient knowledge of the country's population in the field of land legislation;
- Slowdown of land reform;
- etc.

**SOLUTION**:  
To eliminate the above negative consequences, the "Grosland" project was developed, the scope of which extends 
to the territory of the Rozdilna district of the Odesa region.
This project is being developed in the authorâ€™s free time, and some of its components are not public.
